      <description>“Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.” ― Frederick Douglass
 In a community of the oppressed, it is a sin to discuss oppression without discussing the oppressor. To be oppressed is to be a victim. And to be an oppressor you must be the abuser.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write some questions about my experience in these two disciplines and see where and if they intersected. Here are my results so far.

      <description>All dragons must be slain. This is no play on words. From religious symbolism to medieval lore dragons are used to describe the darkest parts of ourselves, the things that keep us up late at night and has a unconscious control over our lives. But slaying the dragon is critical as it is all we should be focused on in life. The process of improving the world I believe starts with ourselves and the battles that rage right under the surface.</description>

      <description>Have you ever read one of those articles on “The secrets to happiness” or “10 tips to finding happiness”? Most of them read as follows:
 What is happiness to you? Be around people that make you smile. Accept the good things in life! Be open to change.  Etc.
These tips are good — if not great if you understand what happiness actually is.
Happiness isn’t a state of mind.</description>
